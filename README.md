Additionally, the dataset was enriched by introducing supplementary features. Additions include calendar-based variables (day of the week, hour of the day, month, etc.), indicators for sunlight, rolling temperature averages, and polynomial features generated from variable pairs. All cyclic variables are encoded using sine and cosine transformations.
